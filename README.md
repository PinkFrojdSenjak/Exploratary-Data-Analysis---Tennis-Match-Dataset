# Exploratary-Data-Analysis---Tennis-Match-Dataset

The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset of a tennis match (Wimbledon finals 2019, Djokovic - Federer), as well as to dive deeper into Exploratary data analysis (EDA).

This project was organized by **Foundley**, an organization with the goal of helping students find mentored projects and internships. I was working in colaboration with [Branko](https://www.google.com) and [Mihailo](https://www.google.com), and mentored by [Mladen]() and [Milan](), who are experts in this field. 

I am very thankful for the opportunity to work on such project, especially for the opportunity to discuss various approaches and techniques with someone who is proficient in the field.

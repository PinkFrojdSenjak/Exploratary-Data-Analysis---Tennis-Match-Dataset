# Exploratary Data Analysis - Tennis Match Dataset

The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset of a tennis match (Wimbledon finals 2019, Djokovic - Federer), as well as to dive deeper into Exploratary data analysis (EDA).

This project was organized by [**Foundley**](https://www.foundley.com/), an organization with the goal of helping students find mentored projects and internships. I was working in colaboration with [Branko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/branko-grbic-857335193/) and [Mihailo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mihailo-grbic-4a13671b0/), and mentored by [Mladen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mladenj/) and [Milan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/novakovic/), who are experts in this field. 

I am very thankful for the opportunity to work on such project, especially for the opportunity to discuss various approaches and techniques with someone who is proficient in the field.

## About the project 

The idea of the project was to perform EDA, which is a crucial step in getting familiar with your data. All 3 of us, Mihailo, Branko and me, explored different aspects of dataset.
Dataset is available for download, under the name **03_tennisai_data.csv**. Column description is available in the file called **03_tennisai_data - data dict.txt**.
